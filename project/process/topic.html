    <h1>Topic 1 | Fast Fashion</h1>
    <p>Fast fashion is the main staple of the fashion industry, providing a wide variety of affordable and stylish clothing to consumers. There are many ethical and environmental issues within the industry itself, and in light of global warming and dangerous working environments, it is more important now than ever to be conscious of where we as consumers shop and the lifecycle of our clothing. There are many companies that are built on sustainable practices, and their new method of producing clothing could be studied and adopted by companies of larger scale.</p>
    <h1>Topic 2 | Storytelling</h1>
    <p>Indigenous people in the Pacific Islands have used storytelling, dance, and music as a medium for passing down culture for hundreds and hundreds of years. The stories of their ancestors and spiritual beliefs are passed down through the generations in this way, and much of their rituals are centered around a time of community gathering and performance. Western colonization and years of cultural immersion has drastically changed the cultural landscape of the islands, and it would be interesting to see how these tribes continue their traditions today</p>
    <h1>Topic 3 | Community College in California</h1>
    <p>I am curious about the community college system in California and how it functions as a cog in the larger system that is the public school system in California. I think that Californians have a distinct advantage when it comes to public education due to the various ways that one could attend a state or UC college, and I think that a lot of it has to do with the way that the community colleges in California are set up.</p>
