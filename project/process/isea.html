    <h1>Fashion and the Environment</h1>

    <p>Julia Wu<br>https://juliaw886.github.io/des157/project/process/research2.html<br><br>Fashion and the Environment is a website that aims to educate consumers on the environmental and social impact of the clothing they purchase in order to encourage them to shop at brands which value sustainability and giving back to the community.<br><br>The site will have three main components: Current Trends in Fashion, Impact on the Environment, and New Systems of Production. Each component will have a scroll-through webpage that takes the user through an article (like an interactive news story would). The aim of the website is to keep the user engaged in the content either through quizzes, animation, videos, or images, and help them digest statistical information in a way that sticks. The articles will also be annotated and highlighted with links that allow the user to navigate away and learn more about the topic. At the very end, the user would give feedback to the website about how their experience was, what stood out most to them about the site, and how it could be improved. This would help the designer (me) to continue tweaking and iterating the site so that it will be more impactful.<br><br>The ISEA Subtheme “Interdisciplinary platforms of coexistence” talks about how technology can be used to increase the public’s awareness in social issues. My site aims to educate and persuade people to be more conscious about their apparel purchase and take environmental and social factors into account when making these decisions.<br><br>I am a third-year design major at the University of California, Davis. I am interested in pop culture and fashion, which is one of the reasons why I decided to design a project around fast fashion.</p>
