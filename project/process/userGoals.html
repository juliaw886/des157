      <h1>User Goals</h1>
      <ul>
        <li><b>How will your users understand the content of the project?</b><br>The landing page of the project will provide a one to two sentenct description about the purpose of the website and what features are in it. There will be a navigation bar that takes the user directly to the subject that they wish to explore. The clothing will be catagorized by type (for example : tops, bottoms, shoes). There will also be an option to filter items by price, brand, and size available. The layout of the website should be similar to enought to most online-stores that the user should know instinctively what to click on. There will be an additional page talking about each brand featured on the website and breaking down how they are being environmentally friendly in producing their clothing.</li>
        <li><b>How will your users understand the primary objectives?</b><br>The user will userstand it through the landing page, where there will be a simple graphic breaking down the purpose of the website and why people should care. Also, each item of clothing will tell the user about how it was environmentally produced. </li>
        <li><b>What content and features do your users need, and in what form do they need it?</b><br>Because I am targeting a young audience, one that is fluent in the web and mobile interfaces, the interface and content needs to be short and to the point. There needs to be a light-hearted or tounge-in-cheek tone to keep users engaged in the conversation. Lastly, there needs to be a selling point BESIDES being environmentally friendly to encourage people to change their spending habits. While I believe that the target generation is more aware about environmental issues than perhaps other generations, the trade-off between the price tag and buying sustainably is not something everyone can afford. Therefore, I have to include some kind of incentive, either organizations that encourage sustainable buying, or creative ways clothes can be upcycled, to really drive home the point and make people want to change their habits.</li>
        <li><b>How do your users think your interactive projects should work and what are their experience levels with the type of media you are creating?</b><br>The users think that interactive projects should be easy to navigate, understand, and have interesting graphics. They are frequent users of the interwebs, so have already a large library of other websites or apps they have seen and used. The catch is that getting their attention will be harder, and making them stay on a webpage will be even harder, so really honing in on the message that the website is sending and then building useful tools/informational materials around that will be crucial. On a more design level, I think that large text, illustrations, and images will be crucial as well.</li>
