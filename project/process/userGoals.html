      <h1>User Goals</h1>
      <ul>
        <li><b>How will your users understand the content of the project?</b><br>The landing page of the project will provide a one to two sentenct description about the purpose of the website and what features are in it. There will be a navigation bar that takes the user directly to the subject that they wish to explore. However, there will be highlighted text that informs the user of the suggested order in which the information should be viewed. Also, there will be an photo or illustration on the landing page that directly relates to how the environment and fashion are linked.</li>
        <li><b>How will your users understand the primary objectives?</b><br>The user will be asked to take a quiz to measure the environmental impact of the buying habits. They will also be asked to choose the more ethical and environmentally-friendly one of two brands. This is all to drive home the idea that what you purchase and where you purchase it has an impact on the environment, and that all companies do things differently. This makes the user evaluate their own spending habits and primes them for the "call to action": choose brands that have ethical and environmental manufacturing practices.</li>
        <li><b>What content and features do your users need, and in what form do they need it?</b></br>Because I am targeting a young audience, one that is fluent in the web and mobile interfaces, the interface and content needs to be short and to the point. There needs to be a light-hearted or tounge-in-cheek tone to keep users engaged in the conversation. Lastly, there needs to be a selling point BESIDES being environmentally friendly to encourage people to change their spending habits. While I believe that the target generation is more aware about environmental issues than perhaps other generations, the trade-off between the price tag and buying sustainably is not something everyone can afford. Therefore, I have to include some kind of incentive, either organizations that encourage sustainable buying, or creative ways clothes can be upcycled, to really drive home the point and make people want to change their habits.</li>
        <li><b>How do your users think your interactive projects should work and what are their experience levels with the type of media you are creating?</b></br>The users think that interactive projects should be easy to navigate, understand, and have interesting graphics. They are frequent users of the interwebs, so have already a large library of other websites or apps they have seen and used. The catch is that getting their attention will be harder, and making them stay on a webpage will be even harder, so really honing in on the message that the website is sending and then building useful tools/informational materials around that will be crucial. On a more design level, I think that large text, illustrations, and images will be crucial as well.</li>
