      '<p>In 1996, Nike faced a controversey surrounding the factories that manufactured their popular shoes. A report detailed the inhumane treatment Vietnamese factory workers were forced to endure. Factory managers punished workers for not wearing regulation shoes by making them run in the hot sun, only allowing them to stop once dozens has fainted. Many workers were also paid under the local minimum wage. These reports circulated in the States and sparked protests against the shoe company. There was a consumer boycott and in 1997 Nike had to layoff employees. <br><br>Things began to change when the company began to value transparency in production and fair wages for workers. It published an 108 page report about the conditions in their factories, and continues to publish reports today. <br><br>It is important to realize the affect that consumers can have on companies, and how the term "vote with your wallet" really does resonate in America.</p>'+
