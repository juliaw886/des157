    <h1>Fashion and the Environment</h1>

    <p>Julia Wu<br>https://juliaw886.github.io/des157/project/process/research2.html<br><br>Fashion and the Environment is a website that aims to provide consumers with a platform where they can shop for sustainably produced clothing. There will also be information about the brands and how their production practices make them more environmentally friendly. The purpose of the website is to be a resource for shoppers who are not aware of the options out there. It also shines a light on the difference in production between companies that are environmentally friendly and companies that are not.
        <br><br>The ISEA Subtheme “Interdisciplinary platforms of coexistence” talks about how technology can be used to increase the public’s awareness in social issues. My site aims to educate and persuade people to be more conscious about their apparel purchase and take environmental and social factors into account when making these decisions.
        <br><br>I am a third-year design major at the University of California, Davis. I am interested in pop culture and fashion, which is one of the reasons why I decided to design a project around fast fashion.</p>
