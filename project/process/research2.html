    <h1>Fast Fashion</h1>

    <p>
    The year is 2015 and major fashion labels have just announced, in their own way, that they are now adopting the fast fashion model into their manufacturing and business model. 
      <br>
Thakoon calls their new model “real-time fashion.” GAP CEO Art Peck recently said that the company was going to start following “Old Navy’s lead on demand-driven buying.” Both are referring to the fast production of clothing which allows brands to frequently change their in-store and online selections. This provides consumers with more options at a lower price and feeds into the desire for newness. 
      <br>
Inditex, the parent company of Zara, has utilized their own fast fashion model to propel them to the top of the clothing manufacturing business and become one of the largest multinational fashion retail groups. It produces clothing in a short time frame and can tailor the selection of each store according to customer needs and the season. The clothing manufacturer also orders smaller quantities of pieces on item-by-item basis, leaving little room for leftover pieces and reducing stockouts. 
      <br>
Many companies are trying to catch up to the leaders of fast fashion, which include Inditex’s Zara, H&M and Forever 21. As consumer interest becomes more and more driven by social media and the digital space, clothing companies are trying to churn out clothes at a faster rate to keep up with the demand. Inditex is famous for being able to order clothing from factories and have them on the racks two weeks later. 
     <br>
According to the Council for Textile Recycling, a nonprofit organization that aims to have zero textile waste in American landfills by 2037, reports that an EPA study in 2009 found that the US generates 25 billion pounds of textiles a year. Of those clothes, 85% of it goes to the landfills. In San Francisco, a 2006 waste characterization study found that textile waste accounted for 0.4% of all waste, which equals 2,120 tons of waste in the landfills.  A study done in 2008 on California’s overall textile was accounted for 2.2% of overall waste, equalling 886,814 tons.

A response to the public’s growing awareness of the impact of their spending has manifested into clothing brands such as Reformation and Everlane. These companies sell clothes which are either locally produced or made with recycled materials. They appeal to a younger audience with the selection of clothing they offer, and offer statistics on what it took to make the item. For example, each clothing item sold on the Reformation site offers a comparison of water consumption and CO2 produced between the Reformation option and industry standard. It is also part of B Corps, a new business model that helps solve environmental and social issues in the community. 
<br>
I think that as people become more aware of the environmental impact of their buying choices, they start associating brands with their environmental impact. While companies like Reformation do a good job of providing an alternative to Zara, I think that the consumer should also be looking at their own spending habits and judging if they are buying something that they will wear only a couple of times or if they are buying something they will wear frequently.
