	<h1>Studio 4 Interface</h1>
	
	<section>
		<h2>Entry 4</h2>
		<p>For Studio 4, I was inspired to make a summer-themed website. I included more interactive and animated elements into the design to catch the users attention the moment they click into the site. I think that animated elements are important because the viewers attention is becoming shorter and shorter, and people's eyes are naturally drawn to things that are in  motion. In addition, I made sure to have visual hiearchy in the type and avoid fonts that look too similar. This helps differentiate which text is supposed to be read first. Lastly, I made the images on the page pretty big and colorful. I think that keeping a primary color palette helps make the color pop more. The colors set the tone of the website and help indicate what it is about.</p>

	<h1>Studio 3 Interfaces</h1>
	
	<section>
		<h2>Entry 3</h2>
		<p>I made an interactive interface featuring the books that I have in my apartment. I have always gravitated towards clean and minimal interfaces, so when designing this webpage I purposefully kept the elements simple. I think that the content speaks for itself and I didn't want the book covers to get lost in any extra design elements. Because clarity is an important aspect of user interface, I figured that keeping it simple was an advatage. The slight rotation of the book covers on hover lets the user know that these elements are interactive, and the yellow button pops up to give suggestions as what the user should do next. Giving the user these clues helps direct them to the purpose of the site. I didn't want to make everything too explicit and explain it in the header, but I do think that adding the pop-up button is a slight nudge in the right direction. I decided to make the button yellow because it contrasts with the rest of the website and is one of the more eye-catching colors. I think that the book covers themselves are what really make the website interesting, and I can see how adding more books would make the website look more interesting. Because there is already so much design on each of the book covers, it's fun to see them displayed in such a digital way and on a stark white background.</p>

	<h1>Evaluating Forms</h1>
	
	<section>
		<h2>Entry 2</h2>
		<p>Forms are sneakily a part of our everyday lives, but often times we simply give them names to differentiate their functions. Emails, search engine bars, online text messaging systems, and Buzzfeed quizzes are an offshoot of the simple idea of taking user input to generate results. My own most commonly used type of form would be email, specifically Gmail. I like keeping the aesthetics of it pretty simple, so I avoid customizing any colors and fonts and installing add-ons. Even at its bare minimum, Gmail is a pretty powerful tool for any students or working professional. With emails popping up in chronological order, the interface provides clarity to the user. The horizontal layout of information such as sender, subject line, and time stamp allows the user to quickly scan for the basics. The lack of hierarchy in the text is purposeful because every user digests information a little differently. One might look at the sender first, while the other scans the subject line. The minimalism allows for flexibility and customization later on. <br> The purpose of Gmail is easily communicated through the red button on the left side of the interface. As one of the few bits of color, the "Compose" button clearly stands out and clearly states that this is a tool for writing and sending emails. I think that the simplicity in the layout is crucial the the success and widespread use of Gmail as the email of choice. Without the clarity of information, simplicity of interface, and purposeful use of design elements, the design would not be as powerful. </p>

	<h1>User Interfaces: Interview Magazine</h1>
	
	<section>
		<h2>Entry 1</h2>
		<p>With it's impactful use of typography and asymmetrical layout, Interview Magazine stands out as a web publication for interesting user interface. The site was clearly designed to mimic a magazine spread, and judiciously spreads out headlines and images throughout each section. This unique look makes the website a memorable one, and certainly captured my attention upon arriving on the landing page. The landing page is also a continuous scroll, making it a little harder to reach the content but also makes the user feel like they are reading the newspaper. I think that the navigation is easy to use because it is fixed at the top of the page, and there is a clear visual hiearchy. My critique would be that the text looks a little squished together in some of the links, and the italic font isn't the easiest to decipher. Overall, I really like the unique layout, that while is unconventional is still anchored by an easily accesible navigation.
