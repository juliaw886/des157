                <span class="bookTitle">Catch 22</span>
                <span class="author">Joseph Heller</span><br>
                <span class="description">Catch 22 details WWII from the perspective of protagonist Army Air Corps Captain John Yossarian. The book is unapologetically satirical, ditching all pretense and heroism in favor of a critical look at the war and the people fighting in it. For one, Yossarian spends the entire book thinking of ways to be discharged from combat. He pretends to be sick multiple times, begs the army doctor to forge medical papers, and eventually *SPOILER ALERT* decides to run away to Sweden to escape the war altogether.</span>

                <span class="author">Eleanor Catton</span>
                <span class="description">A murder mystery set in the time of the New Zealand gold rush, the book details the events of one specific day from the perspective of twelve different people. It keeps a quick pace throughout, never losing steam until the very end and making it a difficult book to put down.</span>

                <span class="description">I haven't actually read this book yet, but it has a really nice cover. It's about a bored British ad-man who escapes to France in the "Eat, Pray, Love" style. But with a murder mystery and shadier characters. Unfortunately, after googling this book for this assignment and reading some reviews, I'm a little less inclined to read it. </span>

                <span class="author">Brian K. Vaughan</span>
                <span class="description">This comic book series was sent to me by a friend and, while I haven't gotten around to it yet, seems like a really interesting read. There's something about the colors and illustrations that screams 80's to me. Written by a former Lost writer and author of a slew of famous Marvel franchises, Paper Girls follows a band of teenagers who get sucked into a fight to save the world.</span>
