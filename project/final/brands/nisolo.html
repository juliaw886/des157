					<li>A typical running shoe releases <a href="http://news.mit.edu/2013/footwear-carbon-footprint-0522">30 lbs of carbon dioxide</a>, and most of the emissions stem from the manufacturing process.</li>
					<li>Most shoes are made in China, where electricity and coal are used frequently to generate steam and run the factory. Discharge from these factories are laced with chemicals and can pollute water sources.</li>
					<li>In <a href="https://www.wewear.org/assets/1/7/101311McConnell.pdf">leather shoe production</a>, untreated tannery effluents contain high quantities of heavy metal when left untreated. Things like adhesives, synthetic rubber, and PVC are also environmental hazards when discarded.</li>
