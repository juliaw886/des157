A report detailed the inhumane treatment Vietnamese factory workers were forced to endure. Factory managers punished workers for not wearing regulation shoes by making them run in the hot sun, only allowing them to stop once dozens has fainted. Many workers were also paid under the local minimum wage. These reports circulated in the States and sparked protests against the shoe company. There was a consumer boycott and in 1997 Nike had to layoff employees. <br><br>Things began to change when the company began to value transparency in production and fair wages for workers. It published an 108 page report about the conditions in their factories, and continues to publish reports today. <br><br>It is important to realize the affect that consumers can have on companies, and how the term "vote with your wallet" really does resonate in America.</p>'+

Police muted the protesters with water cannons a week into the strikes, but more have been happening around the country as Cambodia tries to stay competitive with other Asian coutries in producing garments.<br> Factories them selves have been protecting themselves from growing worker unions.

Before 2008, 1.5 to 2 million schoolchildren were ordered by the government to pick cotton in the fields every year for no pay. They were given a quota that ranged up to 50 kilos and lived in unsanitary conditions for two months. The use of child laborers led to boycotts of the Uzbekistan cotton by major brands, and in turn led to the banning of participation of children under 18 in 2014.. <br>Forced labor of adults continues to this day. Everyone from university students, teachers, scientists, and local administration employees are picked each year to go to the fields and pick cotton. Failure to meet the quota set by the government means loss of jobs, harrassment at the workplace, and increased taxes. Students reported harrassment and threats from teachers and school administrators if they refused to pick cotton or pay for a replacement worker.</p>'+
