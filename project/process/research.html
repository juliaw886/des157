    <h1>Topic 1 | Fast Fashion</h1>
    <img src="images/fastFashion.jpg" alt="Fast Fashion">

    <p>This is a trendy site that publicizes a protest against fast fashion that will be held this year. I chose this site because I think it utilizes lots of great website design and graphic design to create a site that is appealing to people of backgrounds. Specifically, it makes the protest seem “cool” to people who are unfamiliar to the cause and also probably makes them want to learn more about it. 

The interface is easy to use, with a navigation bar at the top of the page that shows a drop-down menu once you hover over it. The font is very easy to use and bold, so that your eye immediately goes to the right bit of information.

    <h1>Topic 2 | Storytelling</h1>
    <img src="images/Hawaii.jpg" alt="Fast Fashion">
    <p>This second site is not directly related to the subject of Pacific Islander culture, but I think it is really interesting how the website highlights bits and pieces of Hawaiian culture while educating people about saving energy and being prepared in case of a natural disaster. It is a scroll-through page that changes backgrounds and full-screen images and you go through the website. It is really to navigate because of that, and I think that it is a really go example of incorporating illustration into a website.
