    <p>Fast fashion is the main staple of the fashion industry, providing a wide variety of affordable and stylish clothing to consumers. There are many ethical and environmental issues within the industry itself, and in light of global warming and dangerous working environments, it is more important now than ever to be conscious of where we as consumers shop and the lifecycle of our clothing. There are many companies that are built on sustainable practices, and their new method of producing clothing could be studied and adopted by companies of larger scale.</p>
      
    <p>I want to make a site that educates people on the carbon footprint of their clothing. Besides helping them calculate the carbon footprint of their clothes, it will highlight better alternatives that are less harmful to the environment. I think that there needs to be a central site where people can visit to receive information about how their clothing is made, what goes into making it, and what other options are out there because there seems to be a dearth of that on the internet right now. Hopefully there can be an interesting interactive feature incorporated as well, like a small game.</p>
